1.Insertion sort (ascending)

2. Insertion sort (descending)

3. Bubble sort and count the total number of swaps

4. Bubble sort and skip even passes

5. BinarySearch (ascending order)

6. BinarySearch (descending order)

7. CountingTargetAppear (binary search)

8. Finding Peak Value (mountain array) (using binary search concept)

9. taking input and display on Linked List

10. even numbers in ascending and odd numbers in descending order using LinkedList

11. counting occurances in array

12. print element of highest frequency first with LinkedList

13. Linear Search to find the first 
negative number in the array. If no negative number is found, print "No negative number". 

14.  Linear Search to find the first occurrence of the target value in the array.

15.   Linear Search to find the last occurrence of the target value in the array.

18. search pair using linear search

19. stack : array implementation

20. stack operation : using Linked list

21. swaps counting in insertion sort

22. queue (circular) operations

23. Take an array of 5 elements. Push all elements into the stack. Pop the elements back into an array. Print the array (it should now be reversed).
